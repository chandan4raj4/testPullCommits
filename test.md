Point and purpose is the key to understanding types of paragraphs and kinds of paragraphs.

In writing, the words point and purpose are almost synonymous. Your point is your purpose,
and how you decide to make your point clear to your reader is also your purpose. Writers
have a point and a purpose for every paragraph that they create.
